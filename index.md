## Tentative Instructions
- Send an email to **xuanw@vt.edu** to be registered. Your participation in the survey **did not** register you. We need to hear from you!
- At the beginning of the examination period, all students will receive a document that contains questions.
- By the end of the examination period, each student must turn in a written solution to one of those questions. The solutions will be no longer than 8 pages (excluding references) at 11 point font or larger using a format to be announced.
- Written solutions should take the form of a scientific paper. It should include at least the following:
  - a motivation section making clear the context of the problem/situation;
  - a clear statement of the problem in terms of concepts and terminology in the information/data area, that addresses the situation/context;
  - a review of related literature, drawn partially from multiple relevant works in the reading list, but must include additional references found by the student during a thorough literature search;
  - a description of approaches to solve the problem; and
  - an evaluation plan for how such approaches would be validated.
- Students will then provide an oral presentation detailing their solution. They must be completed within 15 minutes, of which 12 minutes are for presentation and 3 minutes for answering questions posed by faculty examiners.
  - Each solution will be graded by at least 2 faculty members. A combined grade will then be assigned for each student based on all faculty input by the area committee, on a scale of Pass/Fail, as is called for by GPC policies.
    
## Early Withdrawal Policy
A student registered for the PhD qualifier exam may withdraw at any point of time before the early withdrawal deadline, which is **2/1/2025**. After this date, withdrawal is prohibited. Students with questions about this policy should contact the exam chair directly.

## Academic Integrity
Discussions among students of the papers identified for the exam are reasonable up until the date the exam is released publicly. Once the exam questions are released, we expect all such discussions will cease as students are required to conduct their own work entirely to answer the qualifier questions. This examination is conducted under the [University's Graduate Honor System Code](https://graduateschool.vt.edu/academics/expectations/graduate-honor-system.html). Students are encouraged to draw from other papers than those listed in the exam to the extent that this strengthens their arguments. However, the answers submitted must represent the sole and complete work of the student submitting the answers. Material substantially derived from other works, whether published in print or found on the web, must be explicitly and fully cited. Note that your grade will be more strongly influenced by arguments you make rather than arguments you quote or cite.

## Tentative Reading Lists
The reading lists below cover various topics in the area of data and information. You may choose any one of these lists for your exam. You are expected to significantly expand on your selected list while preparing your written solution. You are also welcome to create your own reading list on a topic not listed here relevant to data and information, but that reading list must be approved by your research advisor by 2/1/2025.

The reading list and qualifying exam topic are not intended to necessarily be your dissertation topic. But you are welcome to make the two overlap if desired. Instead, you will be expected to reason about, write about, conduct a literature search on, and present this topic to demonstrate your ability to conduct doctorate research.

## Grading Scale
